# Homebase

Centralized academic workflow automation ‚Äî assignments from everywhere, in one reliable hub.

# Overview

Homebase is a CLI-based productivity and workflow system that consolidates academic tasks from multiple platforms (Canvas, PrairieLearn, SmartPhysics, Moodle LTI, etc.) into a single hub. The goal is to ensure no assignment slips through the cracks by automatically collecting tasks and generating structured daily/weekly checklists inside Obsidian.

# Features (Current)

‚úÖ CLI application (homebase) with commands: init, doctor, demo, update

‚úÖ Unified task schema (Pydantic model) for consistent representation across sources

‚úÖ Obsidian Markdown templates for daily and master logs

‚úÖ Jinja2 renderer that outputs checklists into your vault

‚úÖ Relative due date formatting (‚Äúdue today‚Äù, ‚Äúdue in 3 days‚Äù, ‚Äúoverdue by 2 hr‚Äù)

‚úÖ Stable assignment IDs (SHA1 fingerprints) to support rollover

# Roadmap

 Phase 1: CLI tool, JSON schema, Obsidian integration

 Phase 2: Source integrations (Canvas/Moodle LTI, PrairieLearn, SmartPhysics)

 Phase 3: Calendar sync + priority system

 Phase 4: Advanced scheduling & AI-driven study planner

# Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.11+

CLI: Typer

Test the install:

homebase --help


You should see available commands.

First Run

Initialize Homebase with your vault path:

homebase init


Example values:

Vault path: C:/Users/adria/Documents/Obsidian/Vault

Timezone: America/Chicago (or your IANA tz name)

Validate configuration:

homebase doctor


Generate demo notes:

homebase demo


This creates:

Assignments/Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md

Assignments/Master.md

inside your Obsidian vault.

Open Obsidian and check your new notes üéâ

Next Steps

Implement real source integrations (Canvas, PrairieLearn, etc.) inside homebase/sources/.

Add rollover logic for unfinished tasks.

Extend CLI with filters and weekly summaries.
